# PROJECT-3
This project analyzes Instagram post performance using a dataset containing post details such as Post ID, Post Type, number of Likes, and Comments. The goal is to uncover patterns in audience engagement across different post types—Carousel, Reels, and Images—and provide actionable insights to optimize social media content strategy.
